Contact Form 7 - Add useful modules such as hidden fields and "send all fields" to the Contact Form 7 plugin

== Description ==

### Add Hidden Fields to Contact Form 7

The Contact Form 7 plugin has over <em>8.4 million</em> downloads, yet the great plugin still lacks a simple feature: <strong>hidden fields</strong>. This plugin adds hidden fields to Contact Form 7 once and for all.

#### Inserting dynamic values

You can also choose to have the value of the hidden field dynamically populated in your form when you are contacted. To do so, choose the "Default value" to be:

* `post_title` - Inserts the title of the post/page
* `post_category` - The categories of the post or page
* `post_url` - The URL of the post or page
* `post_author` - The author of the post or page
* `custom_field-[Name]` - The value of a post or page's custom field. If you had a custom field "Foo", you would use the following as the hidden field value: `custom_field-Foo`

<strong>You can also use a filter:</strong> hook into the `wpcf7_hidden_field_value` filter to modify the value of the hidden field  using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter" rel="nofollow"><code>add_filter()</code></a>. If you know the ID of the input, you can also use the `wpcf7_hidden_field_value_[#ID]` filter.

Now, when someone contacts you using your Contact Form 7 contact form, you can have lots more information about their visit - and you'll see it when you receive the email that tells you you've been contacted.

### Easily Send All Submitted Fields At Once

####Save time setting up your form emails...and never miss a field!

One of the limitations of Contact Form 7 is that you need to manually add each field to generated emails. This means that if you update the form with a new field and forget to add it to your email message, you won't receive it in your email. <strong>No longer.</strong>.

Using the <strong>Send All Fields</strong> module, you simply need to add `[all-fields]` to your message, and you will receive every field submitted. If you use HTML formatting, the formatting even looks nice.

* Fixed: issue in Hidden Fields where the `[hidden-###]` shortcode no longer worked and only `[post_title]` format worked.
    * Added: Hidden fields now support both formats: `[hidden-123]` and `[post_title]` as long as they're in the form itself.

* Added `wpcf7_send_all_fields_format_key` filter to Send All Fields plugin to turn on or off formatting of the key (replacing `example-key` with `Example Key` in output). See "How do I turn off formatting the key in the `[all-fields]` output?" in the FAQ.
